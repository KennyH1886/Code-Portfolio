An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, , of size , each memory location has some unique index,  (where ), that can be referenced as  or .

### **Problem Description:**
You need to complete the `reverseArray` function, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the array in reverse order.

### **Function Signature:**
```python
def reverseArray(a):
```

- **Input:**
  - An array `a` of integers.

- **Output:**
  - The same array, but reversed.

---

### **Solution:**

1. **Using Python's List Slicing:**
   Python offers a simple way to reverse a list using slicing. The syntax `a[::-1]` allows you to reverse a list by traversing it from the end to the beginning.

2. **Code Implementation:**

```python
#!/bin/python3

import os

def reverseArray(a):
    # Reverse the array using slicing
    return a[::-1]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Open a file to write the output (this environment might require output to a file)
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')
    
    # Read the size of the array
    arr_count = int(input().strip())
    
    # Read the array of integers
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    
    # Call the reverseArray function and store the result
    res = reverseArray(arr)
    
    # Write the reversed array to the output file
    fptr.write(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    fptr.write('\n')
    
    # Close the output file
    fptr.close()
```

### **Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Array Reversal Using Slicing:**
   ```python
   return a[::-1]
   ```
   - `a[::-1]` is Python slicing syntax that returns the array in reverse order:
     - `a` is the array.
     - `:` means traverse the array.
     - `-1` specifies to traverse from the end to the beginning.

2. **Handling Input and Output:**
   - `arr_count = int(input().strip())` reads the size of the array.
   - `arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))` reads the array of integers and converts them into a list.
   - `fptr.write(' '.join(map(str, res)))` writes the reversed array to the output, converting integers to strings for correct formatting.

### **Example:**

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output:**
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

### **Time Complexity of the `reverseArray` Function:**

The main operation in the `reverseArray` function is reversing the array using Python slicing. Letâ€™s analyze the time complexity step-by-step:

---

### **Key Operation:**
```python
return a[::-1]
```
- **Slicing (`a[::-1]`)**:
  - When we use slicing to reverse an array, Python creates a new list and fills it with the elements of the original list in reverse order.
  - To reverse an array of length `n`, Python has to copy each of the `n` elements from the original list into the new list, but in reverse order.
  - This operation takes linear time, or **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array.

---

### **Input/Output Operations:**
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))`: This line reads the input and splits it into integers. Since the list is being constructed element-by-element, the time complexity for this operation is also **O(n)**.
   
2. **Writing Output:**
   - `fptr.write(' '.join(map(str, res)))`: This operation converts the reversed list to a string and writes it to the output. Converting the list of integers into a string takes **O(n)** time since it processes each element individually.

---

### **Total Time Complexity:**

- The most time-consuming step is the array reversal (`a[::-1]`), which takes **O(n)** time.
- Input and output operations also take **O(n)** time.

Thus, the total time complexity of the function is dominated by the array reversal and input/output, which gives an overall time complexity of:

**O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- The function efficiently reverses the array in linear time, which is optimal for this type of operation.

This should give you a clear understanding of how the time complexity of your `reverseArray` function is calculated. Let me know if you'd like any more details!
