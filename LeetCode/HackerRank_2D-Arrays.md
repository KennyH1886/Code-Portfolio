Answer: 

### **Understanding the Question:**

We are given a **6x6 matrix (2D array)** of integers, and we need to find the maximum sum of specific patterns in this matrix known as **hourglasses**.

#### **What is an Hourglass in a Matrix?**

An hourglass in a matrix looks like this:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

This means an hourglass includes 7 values from the matrix arranged in the form of 3 values at the top, 1 in the middle, and 3 at the bottom.

For example, in a 6x6 matrix, one possible hourglass could start at position `(0,0)`:

```
1 1 1     <- top row
  1       <- middle element
1 1 1     <- bottom row
```

The sum of this hourglass would be the sum of these 7 elements:
```
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7
```

#### **Problem Breakdown:**

- We are asked to find **all possible hourglasses** in the 6x6 matrix.
- For each hourglass, we need to calculate the **sum** of the 7 values.
- Finally, we need to **return the maximum** hourglass sum.

Since the matrix is fixed at **6x6**, the top-left corner of an hourglass can only be placed within certain bounds. Specifically, the top-left corner can be placed anywhere from row 0 to row 3 and column 0 to column 3, because an hourglass takes up 3 rows and 3 columns.

Thus, there are **16 possible hourglasses** in the 6x6 matrix:
- 4 possibilities in the first 4 rows (since the hourglass takes up 3 rows).
- 4 possibilities in the first 4 columns (since the hourglass takes up 3 columns).
- In total: 4 rows Ã— 4 columns = 16 possible hourglasses.

#### **Goal:**
We need to calculate the sum of each hourglass and then find the **maximum** of these sums.

---

### **Solution Breakdown:**

1. **Iterate over the possible top-left corners** of each hourglass in the 6x6 matrix. The top-left corner can range from index `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` because each hourglass is 3x3 in size.

2. For each hourglass, **calculate the sum** of its 7 elements using this formula:

   ```
   arr[i][j]   + arr[i][j+1]   + arr[i][j+2]   (top row)
                arr[i+1][j+1]                   (middle element)
   arr[i+2][j] + arr[i+2][j+1] + arr[i+2][j+2] (bottom row)
   ```

3. Keep track of the **maximum sum** encountered as we calculate the sum for each hourglass.

4. **Return the maximum sum** after processing all possible hourglasses.

### **In-Depth Explanation of the Code:**

```python
#!/bin/python3

import os

def hourglassSum(arr):
    # Initialize to a very small number because we might have negative numbers in the matrix.
    max_sum = -float('inf')  # -infinity ensures that the first comparison will replace this with any valid sum.
    
    # Loop through all valid starting points of an hourglass in the 6x6 matrix.
    for i in range(4):  # Loop through rows 0 to 3
        for j in range(4):  # Loop through columns 0 to 3
            # Calculate the sum of the current hourglass
            top = arr[i][j] + arr[i][j+1] + arr[i][j+2]
            middle = arr[i+1][j+1]
            bottom = arr[i+2][j] + arr[i+2][j+1] + arr[i+2][j+2]
            
            hourglass_sum = top + middle + bottom  # The total sum of the hourglass
            
            # Update max_sum if the current hourglass sum is greater
            if hourglass_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = hourglass_sum
    
    return max_sum  # Return the maximum hourglass sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    arr = []

    # Read the 6x6 matrix from input
    for _ in range(6):
        arr.append(list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())))

    result = hourglassSum(arr)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
```

### **Detailed Walkthrough of the Code:**

1. **Initialize `max_sum`:**
   We initialize `max_sum` to `-float('inf')` (negative infinity). This ensures that any hourglass sum we calculate will be larger than this initial value, so we can update `max_sum` accordingly.

2. **Iterate Over the Matrix:**
   We loop through all possible top-left corners of the hourglasses. Since the matrix is 6x6, the valid indices for the top-left corner are from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.

   This is why the loop iterates from `i = 0 to 3` and `j = 0 to 3`. These loops allow us to check all the hourglasses in the matrix.

3. **Calculate the Hourglass Sum:**
   For each valid top-left corner `(i, j)`, we calculate the sum of the current hourglass using:
   - **Top row:** `arr[i][j] + arr[i][j+1] + arr[i][j+2]`
   - **Middle element:** `arr[i+1][j+1]`
   - **Bottom row:** `arr[i+2][j] + arr[i+2][j+1] + arr[i+2][j+2]`
   
   We then sum these values to get the total hourglass sum.

4. **Update Maximum Hourglass Sum:**
   We compare the current hourglass sum with `max_sum`. If the current sum is larger, we update `max_sum`.

5. **Return the Maximum Hourglass Sum:**
   After checking all 16 possible hourglasses, we return the `max_sum`, which now holds the maximum hourglass sum found.

### **Example:**

Let's break down the example given in the problem:

#### Input Matrix:
```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
```

#### All Hourglass Sums:
```
7, 4, 2, 0
4, 8, 10, 8
3, 8, 12, 10
2, 7, 9, 7
```

The maximum hourglass sum is **19**.

#### Hourglass Producing Maximum Sum:
```
2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
```

Thus, the maximum hourglass sum is **19**.

---

### **Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the matrix size is fixed at 6x6. Even though we're looping through parts of the matrix, we always process a fixed amount of data, so the time complexity does not depend on the size of the input.
