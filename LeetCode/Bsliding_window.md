Certainly! Let’s dive deeper into the solution for finding the **length of the longest substring without repeating characters** using the **sliding window technique**. Here's a more detailed explanation with all the steps involved.

## Problem Overview:

We are given a string `s`, and we are tasked with finding the longest substring without repeating characters. A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. We need to find the length of the longest such substring.

### Key Points:
- A **substring** is a part of the string where all characters must be contiguous.
- The **characters in the substring must be unique** (no repeats).
- We need to find the **maximum length** of such a substring.
  
### Example Walkthroughs:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `s = "abcabcbb"`
- **Output**: `3` (The answer is `"abc"` with length `3`).

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `s = "bbbbb"`
- **Output**: `1` (The answer is `"b"` with length `1`).

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `s = "pwwkew"`
- **Output**: `3` (The answer is `"wke"` with length `3`).

## Approach: Sliding Window

We use the **sliding window technique** to solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string. Let’s understand how this works:

### Key Idea:
The sliding window keeps track of a **window of characters** in the string where no character is repeated. The window expands as we move through the string from left to right. If we encounter a duplicate character, we **shrink** the window by moving the left boundary of the window.

### Components:
1. **Two pointers (`left` and `right`)**: 
   - These pointers will define the current substring we are examining.
   - The `right` pointer moves through the string to include more characters in the window.
   - The `left` pointer moves to the right to shrink the window whenever we encounter a duplicate character.
   
2. **Set (`char_set`)**: 
   - We use a set to keep track of the unique characters in the current window.
   - A set is ideal because checking if a character exists in the set and adding/removing characters are O(1) operations.

3. **Variable (`max_length`)**: 
   - This stores the length of the longest substring without repeating characters found so far.

---

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - A set `char_set` to track the characters currently in the window.
   - Two pointers `left` and `right` both initialized to `0`. These pointers define the current window.
   - A variable `max_length` initialized to `0` to store the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters.

2. **Iterate Through the String Using the `right` Pointer**:
   - The `right` pointer expands the window by moving one character at a time.
   - For each character `s[right]` in the string:
     - **If `s[right]` is already in the set** (meaning we found a duplicate):
       - We need to **shrink the window** from the left by moving the `left` pointer to the right until the duplicate character is removed.
       - To shrink the window, we keep removing `s[left]` from the set and incrementing `left` by 1 until the duplicate is gone.
     - **Add `s[right]` to the set** to continue expanding the window.
     - **Update `max_length`** to be the maximum of the current `max_length` and the current window size (`right - left + 1`).

3. **Continue Until the End of the String**:
   - The `right` pointer continues until it reaches the end of the string, expanding and shrinking the window as necessary.

4. **Return `max_length`**:
   - After the loop completes, return `max_length`, which contains the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    # Set to store the characters in the current window
    char_set = set()
    
    # Initialize two pointers for the sliding window
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    # Traverse the string using the right pointer
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # If the character at right pointer is in the set, shrink the window
        while s[right] in char_set:
            # Remove the character at the left pointer and move left pointer forward
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        # Add the current character to the set
        char_set.add(s[right])
        
        # Update the maximum length of the substring found so far
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **`char_set`**: 
   - A set to store the unique characters currently in the window (substring).
   
2. **`left` and `right`**:
   - The `left` pointer defines the start of the window, and the `right` pointer is used to expand the window character by character as we move through the string.
   
3. **While loop to Shrink the Window**:
   - Whenever a duplicate character is found (i.e., `s[right]` is already in `char_set`), we keep removing characters from the left of the window (by moving `left` to the right) until there are no duplicates.
   
4. **Add `s[right]` to the Set**:
   - After removing any duplicates, add `s[right]` to the set to include it in the current window.
   
5. **Update `max_length`**:
   - The length of the current window is `right - left + 1`. We update `max_length` with the maximum of the current window size and the previous `max_length`.

6. **Return**:
   - After the loop, return `max_length` which will contain the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `s = "abcabcbb"`

1. **Initial state**: `left = 0`, `right = 0`, `max_length = 0`, `char_set = {}`.
2. **Right = 0, `s[right] = "a"`**: No duplicates, add `"a"` to `char_set`. Update `max_length = 1`.
   - `char_set = {"a"}`, `left = 0`, `max_length = 1`.
3. **Right = 1, `s[right] = "b"`**: No duplicates, add `"b"` to `char_set`. Update `max_length = 2`.
   - `char_set = {"a", "b"}`, `left = 0`, `max_length = 2`.
4. **Right = 2, `s[right] = "c"`**: No duplicates, add `"c"` to `char_set`. Update `max_length = 3`.
   - `char_set = {"a", "b", "c"}`, `left = 0`, `max_length = 3`.
5. **Right = 3, `s[right] = "a"`**: Duplicate found (`"a"` is already in the set).
   - Move `left` to 1 (remove `"a"` from `char_set`), then add `"a"` back.
   - `char_set = {"b", "c", "a"}`, `left = 1`.
6. **Continue expanding the window**, updating `max_length` to `3`.
7. The final `max_length = 3`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).
2. **Space Complexity**: O(min(m, n)), where `m` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters) and `n` is the length of the string. We are using a set to store unique characters in the current window.
