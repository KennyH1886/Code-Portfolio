## Problem Breakdown

You need to implement a class `RandomizedSet` with the following methods:

1. **`insert(int val)`**: Inserts a value into the set if it is not already present. Returns `true` if the value was successfully inserted, and `false` if the value already exists.
2. **`remove(int val)`**: Removes a value from the set if it exists. Returns `true` if the value was successfully removed, and `false` if the value is not present.
3. **`getRandom()`**: Returns a random element from the current set. Each element must have an equal probability of being chosen. 

You must ensure that each operation (insert, remove, and getRandom) runs in average **O(1)** time complexity.

## Solution Approach

To achieve the O(1) time complexity for all operations, we can use a combination of:
- **A list**: This will allow us to store elements and efficiently access them for the `getRandom` operation.
- **A hash map (dictionary)**: This will allow us to map values to their indices in the list, enabling O(1) insertions, deletions, and lookups.

### Key Points:
1. **Insert Operation**:
   - If the value is not present in the set, append it to the list and store its index in the hash map.
   - If the value is already present, return `false`.

2. **Remove Operation**:
   - To maintain O(1) removal, we swap the element to be removed with the last element in the list and then remove the last element. This ensures that removing an element doesn’t require shifting other elements in the list.
   - After swapping, update the hash map with the new index of the swapped element.
   - Finally, remove the value from both the list and the hash map.

3. **GetRandom Operation**:
   - Since we are using a list, returning a random element can be achieved by randomly selecting an index from the list using Python’s `random.choice`.

## Code Implementation:

```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        # List to store the elements
        self.nums = []
        # Hash map to store the indices of elements
        self.num_to_index = {}

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        # If the value already exists, return False
        if val in self.num_to_index:
            return False
        # Append the value to the list and record its index in the hash map
        self.nums.append(val)
        self.num_to_index[val] = len(self.nums) - 1
        return True

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        # If the value doesn't exist, return False
        if val not in self.num_to_index:
            return False
        # Get the index of the element to remove
        index_to_remove = self.num_to_index[val]
        last_element = self.nums[-1]

        # Move the last element to the position of the element to remove
        self.nums[index_to_remove] = last_element
        self.num_to_index[last_element] = index_to_remove

        # Remove the last element from the list
        self.nums.pop()
        # Remove the element from the hash map
        del self.num_to_index[val]
        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        # Return a random element from the list
        return random.choice(self.nums)
```

### Explanation of Each Method:

1. **`__init__()`**: 
   - Initializes an empty list `nums` and an empty dictionary `num_to_index` to store the elements and their corresponding indices.

2. **`insert(int val)`**:
   - First, check if `val` is already in the set by checking `num_to_index`. If it is, return `false`.
   - If it isn’t, append `val` to the `nums` list and store the index in `num_to_index`. Return `true` as the insertion is successful.

3. **`remove(int val)`**:
   - Check if `val` exists in the set. If it doesn’t, return `false`.
   - If it does exist, get its index and the last element in the list.
   - Swap the element to be removed with the last element in the list. Update the index of the last element in the hash map.
   - Pop the last element from the list and remove the element from the hash map.
   - Return `true` as the removal is successful.

4. **`getRandom()`**:
   - Use Python’s `random.choice()` to randomly select an element from the `nums` list. Since all elements are stored in the list and have equal probability, this ensures that the operation is O(1).

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:
```
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
```

**Execution**:

1. **`RandomizedSet()`**: Initialize the set.
   - `nums = []`
   - `num_to_index = {}`

2. **`insert(1)`**: Insert 1 into the set.
   - `nums = [1]`
   - `num_to_index = {1: 0}`
   - Output: `true`

3. **`remove(2)`**: Try to remove 2, but it doesn't exist.
   - Output: `false`

4. **`insert(2)`**: Insert 2 into the set.
   - `nums = [1, 2]`
   - `num_to_index = {1: 0, 2: 1}`
   - Output: `true`

5. **`getRandom()`**: Randomly return either 1 or 2.
   - Output: `1` or `2` (both are equally likely)

6. **`remove(1)`**: Remove 1 from the set.
   - Swap 1 with 2 (the last element).
   - `nums = [2]`
   - `num_to_index = {2: 0}`
   - Output: `true`

7. **`insert(2)`**: Try to insert 2 again, but it's already in the set.
   - Output: `false`

8. **`getRandom()`**: Since 2 is the only element, it will return 2.
   - Output: `2`

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Insert**: O(1) because appending to the list and updating the dictionary take constant time.
   - **Remove**: O(1) because we swap elements and update the dictionary in constant time.
   - **GetRandom**: O(1) because retrieving a random element from the list is constant time.

2. **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the set. Both the list and the dictionary store `n` elements.

---

This solution ensures that all operations—`insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom`—work in constant average time (O(1)), meeting the problem requirements.
