Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the problem and solution formatted in Markdown:

## Problem Recap

You are given an encoded string, where parts of the string are repeated a specific number of times. The format is always in the form `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to decode the string and return the fully expanded result.

## Example 1 Walkthrough

**Input**: `"3[a]2[bc]"`

- `3[a]` means "repeat 'a' 3 times", so that part expands to `"aaa"`.
- `2[bc]` means "repeat 'bc' 2 times", so that part expands to `"bcbc"`.
- The final output after combining is `"aaabcbc"`.

## Solution Breakdown

We process the string character by character, using a **stack-based approach** to manage nested encodings. Here's how we handle different parts of the string:

### Approach

1. **Digits**: 
   - Digits indicate how many times we need to repeat the upcoming part of the string inside brackets.
   - Digits can be multi-digit numbers, so we need to build the full number incrementally.

2. **Opening Bracket `[`**:
   - This signals the start of an encoded section. Before processing it:
     - Push the current number onto a **count stack**.
     - Push the current partial string onto a **string stack**.
     - Reset both the number and the current partial string to prepare for the new encoded section.

3. **Closing Bracket `]`**:
   - This signals the end of an encoded section. When we encounter it:
     - Pop the number from the **count stack**, which tells us how many times to repeat the current string.
     - Pop the previous string from the **string stack**, which is the string that was being built before encountering the `[` bracket.
     - Multiply the current string by the number, and append it to the previous string.

4. **Characters (letters)**:
   - These are directly appended to the current partial string.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize stacks for numbers (count_stack) and strings (string_stack)
        count_stack = []
        string_stack = []
        
        # Initialize variables to store the current string and current number
        current_string = ""  # Stores the part of the string currently being decoded
        current_num = 0  # Stores the current number (k)

        # Iterate through each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the current character is a digit, build the current number
                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # When encountering '[', push current_num and current_string to stacks
                count_stack.append(current_num)  # Save the number before resetting it
                string_stack.append(current_string)  # Save the current string before resetting it
                
                # Reset current_num and current_string for the new encoded part
                current_string = ""  # Reset for the new string inside the brackets
                current_num = 0  # Reset for the next number
            elif char == ']':
                # When encountering ']', resolve the current encoded part
                repeat_count = count_stack.pop()  # Get how many times to repeat the string
                previous_string = string_stack.pop()  # Get the string built before '['
                
                # Repeat the current_string `repeat_count` times and append to the previous string
                current_string = previous_string + current_string * repeat_count
            else:
                # Append letters directly to the current string
                current_string += char

        # The final decoded string will be in current_string
        return current_string
```

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Stacks

We use two stacks:
- **`count_stack`**: Stores the multiplier `k` for each encoded section.
- **`string_stack`**: Stores the previous string that was built before encountering an opening bracket `[`.

### Iteration Process

- **If `char` is a digit**: Build the `current_num`, which tells us how many times the string inside the brackets should be repeated.
  
- **If `char` is `[`**: 
   - Push the current number `current_num` onto the `count_stack`.
   - Push the current partial string `current_string` onto the `string_stack`.
   - Reset both `current_num` and `current_string` to handle the next part of the encoded section.

- **If `char` is `]`**:
   - Pop the `repeat_count` from the `count_stack` (how many times to repeat the string).
   - Pop the `previous_string` from the `string_stack` (the string built before encountering the `[`).
   - Repeat `current_string` by `repeat_count` and append it to `previous_string`.

- **If `char` is a letter**: Append the letter to `current_string`.

### Final Result

At the end of the iteration, `current_string` contains the fully decoded string.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the use of stacks to store numbers and partial strings.

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1: `"3[a]2[bc]"`

1. We encounter `'3'`, so `current_num` becomes `3`.
2. We encounter `'['`, so we push `3` onto `count_stack` and `""` onto `string_stack`. We reset `current_num` and `current_string`.
3. We encounter `'a'`, so `current_string` becomes `"a"`.
4. We encounter `']'`, so we pop `3` from `count_stack` and `""` from `string_stack`. We repeat `"a"` 3 times and concatenate it to `""`, so `current_string` becomes `"aaa"`.
5. We encounter `'2'`, so `current_num` becomes `2`.
6. We encounter `'['`, so we push `2` onto `count_stack` and `"aaa"` onto `string_stack`. We reset `current_num` and `current_string`.
7. We encounter `'b'`, so `current_string` becomes `"b"`.
8. We encounter `'c'`, so `current_string` becomes `"bc"`.
9. We encounter `']'`, so we pop `2` from `count_stack` and `"aaa"` from `string_stack`. We repeat `"bc"` 2 times and concatenate it to `"aaa"`, so `current_string` becomes `"aaabcbc"`.

**Final Output**: `"aaabcbc"`

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently decodes nested encoded strings using a **stack-based approach** to handle numbers, letters, and brackets. The solution ensures that each part of the encoded string is correctly expanded and concatenated as specified by the input.
