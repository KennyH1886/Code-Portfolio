# Graphs
can models the internet , social networks , games and more 

## STL list of data structures 
stack/queue   \
vector : array where you dont have to worry about size  \
map \
set \
priority queue
list-> double \
forward-list -> single linekd list  \
deque(deck) -> similiar to vector, double ended 
  



# graph example problems 

  ### maze
  ### 3 missionaries & 3 cannables example
  ###  connect 4 
  ### chess 



  # adjency matrix  O(n) to O(n^2) depending on number of edges 

  used to help represent a graph 
  
  uses linear algebra concepts 

  # weighted graph 

  important when making driving directions 

  # space complexity O(n^2)

  (10^9)^2 = 10^18


  # Adjacency list 
O(|E|) : cardinality of the set , amount of items in set \
 {1,2,3,5} = |E| = 4 (amount in set)

 O(max(|v|, &)) more accurate , number of vertices


complexity is O(n)
 ### degree : number of edges
 > count number of 1's in graph in certain examples



 #### in-degree: number of edges coming in  
 #### out-degree: number of degrees going out
 > look at columns


20 friends = 20 steps


# Dictionary

instead of a list of linked list you can use a map.
