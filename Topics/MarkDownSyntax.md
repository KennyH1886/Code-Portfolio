## Mark Down Syntax

#### Lists

#- this is for a heading , add more to decrese the font size and make sub headings

"-" this will make a bullet point list.

Space as normal for indenting 
 
"1." numbers will make lettered list in abc order.

#### Links 

if you want to do links there are two parts
"[for the description]"( link / usually another file in git.)""

unordered list can also use 

-  minuses
+ Or pluses

#### Code syntax's

" `example` "   use this for variables or coding type of syntax 

````html
<p> a paragraph example in html, use four "`" to sstart and end note.</p>
````

````javascript
let num = Math.random();
````

#### Heading

"![alt text](image link in git )"

some paragraph with text 
> blockquote text below paragraph.

| heading | header | head|
|---| ---| ---| 
| content | more content | text|
| more | more | more |

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

This is *italics* and **bold** 

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~


#### Block Quotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
