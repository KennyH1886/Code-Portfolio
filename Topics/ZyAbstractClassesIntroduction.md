# Abstract classes: Introduction (generic)
## Abstract classes
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm, consisting of several features. Three key features include:

***Classes:*** A class encapsulates data and behavior to create objects.
***Inheritance:*** Inheritance allows one class (a subclass) to be based on another class (a base class or superclass). Ex: A Shape class may encapsulate data and behavior for geometric shapes, like setting/getting the Shape's name and color, while a Circle class may be a subclass of a Shape, with additional features like setting/getting the center point and radius.
***Abstract classes:*** An abstract class is a class that guides the design of subclasses but cannot itself be instantiated as an object. Ex: An abstract Shape class might also specify that any subclass must define a computeArea() method.
